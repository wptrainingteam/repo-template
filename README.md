# Repo Structure and Lesson Plan Template

## Objectives

It’s recommended that you include a bulleted list of objective(s) for each lesson plan. Objectives should be worded as actions that the student can do once they’ve finished. See [Bloom's Taxonomy of Action Verbs](http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/oie/documents/assesments/Blooms%20Level.pdf) (PDF) as a reference. Avoid using words like "know," "understand," "be introduced to," etc.
